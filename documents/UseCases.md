Week 1 – Use Cases
LING 508
Emily Delgadillo

I have decided I want to make a tool that helps plan workouts, similar to the yoga example used in
class. I struggle to workout on my own without a trainer because I don’t know how to plan workouts,
I’m hoping this could help me with a real life struggle!

####Plan Your Workouts

####Use Case 1: Identify and return exercises based on target muscle group.
Example Inputs: legs, core, arms
Example Outputs: sumo squats, lunges, dead lifting

####Use Case 2: Return exercises based on workout type.
Example Inputs: cardio, strength, mobility, flexibility
Example Outputs: jumping jacks, burpees, standing hamstring stretch

####Use Case 3: Filter exercises based on equipment available.
Example Inputs: dumbbells, barbells, treadmill, resistance bands
Example Outputs: banded squats, bench press, sumo deadlift

####Use Case 4: Generate workout plan based on time available.
This use case would be a combination of all 3 above use cases taking into consideration target muscle
group, workout type, and equipment available to the user.
Example Input: 30 (to be understood as minutes)
Example Output:
5 minutes warm up: 2-3 stretches, low impact cardio
20 minutes weight lifting circuit: 4-5 different exercises
5 minutes cool down: 2-3 stretches, 1 min of low impact cardio
Each section to include: recommended duration per movement, number of rounds

The dream would be to have images demonstrating each movement but that may not be feasible for the
limited time we have.
